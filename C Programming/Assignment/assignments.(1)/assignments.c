1) What is a shofteare? What is software engineering?

Shoftware is a set of instruction,data or programs that tell a computer.
Shoftwere is that part of a computer, which can not ne touched. shoftwere tell a computer what to do and how to do it.
Shoftwere engineering is a technique through which we can developed or created shoftwere foe computer system and any other electronic devices.
Shoftwere engineering is a process in which used need are analyzes and shoftwere is designed based on there needs.
In Shoftwere engineering the development of shoftwere using well define scientific principle, method and procedures.
shoftwere engineering build these Shoftwere and application by using designing and progreming languages.
   In order to create a complex shoftwere we should use shoftwere engineering techique as well as to reduce the comlexility we should use abstraction
snd decomposition where abstraction describes only importent part of the shoftwere and leave irrelevent things for later stage of development so the
requrement of shoftwere be come simple. And decomposition breakdown the softwere into no of module where each module produces a well defined independent
task.

2) Explain types of shoftwere.
    1) system softwere
    2) Application softwere
    3) utility software
   
   1) system softwere :- system softwere is a softwere designed to provide a platgrom to other softwere. system sotwere control and manage the operation
                         of computer hardware.
                        Ex : Operating syatem (windows,Android,linux etc...)
   2) Application:- The softwere that helps you to do a specific type of work is called application softwere.
                    Ex : (Ms word, Excel etc....)
   3) utility softwere :- Utility softwere helps to manage, maintain and control computer resorces.
                          Ex : antivirus softwere, backup softwere, Disk tools etc...)

3) what is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC
   SDLC :- The softwere developement Life cycle.
           The softwere developement life cycle is a structured process that enables the production of high-quility,lowcost softwere, in the shortest possible
           production time. the goal of the SDLC is to produce superior softwere that meets and exceeds all customer expectation and demands.
           
   There are 7 step in SDLC.

          1) Requirements :- In order understand what requirements are, it is necessary to know why one needs them. Basically, requirements are statements that 
                             indicate what a system needs to do in order to provide a capability. Requirements are generally prepared duringg the early stages 
                             of a projects system development lifecycle.
          2) Analysis :- An analysis is just the process of breaking something down and figuring out how it works.
          3) Designing :- Design means to create a plan or sketch of something that is going to be made later, especially a plan that details what the finished 
                          thing will do and look like. A design is the plan or sketch created as a result of this activity. Design also means to intend something
                          for a specific purpose.
          4) Development :- Development is the process of growth of a particular thing.
                            In economics it is related to infrastructure, resources including human resource and natural resources.
          5) Testing :- The testing phase of the software development lifecycle is where you focus on investigation and discovery. During the testing phase, 
                        developers find out whether their code and programming work according to customer requirements.
          6) deployment :- The deployment phase is the final phase of the software development life cycle and puts the product into production. After the project 
                            team tests the product and the product passes each testing phase, the product is ready to go live.
          7) Maintenance :- The maintenance phase of the SDLC occurs after the product is in full operation. Maintenance of software can include software upgrades, 
                            repairs, and fixes of the software if it breaks.
                            Software applications often need to be upgraded or integrated with new systems the customer deploys.


4) What is DFD? Create a DFD diagram on Flipkart

         DFD means "Data flow Diagram.
         It is also known as Bubble chart through which we can represent the flow of data graphically in an information system.
         By using DFD We can easily understand the overall functionality of system because diagram represents the incoming data flow outgoing data flow and stored data in a graphical from.
         It describes how data is processed in a system in them of input and output.
         A DFD model uses a no. of notations or symbol to represent flow of data.

5) What is Flow chart? Create a flowchart to make addition of two numbers

        Flowchart is a symbolic or diagrammatic representation of an algorithm. It uses several geometrical figures to represent the operation, and arrow to show the direction of flow.
